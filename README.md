## Markdown in MarkNote

### Headings
To add a heading into a note add one to four `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#`'s determines the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.
In the editor toolbar there is a heading helper button to automate the syntax with a button press.

```
# A first heading
## A second heading
### A third heading
#### A fourth heading
```

You can add maths equations inline by inserting `$` around your equation. You can make a maths equation block using `$$`.

```
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are

$$ 
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} 
$$
```

```
This is a simple footnote[^1].

This footnote has multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
  This is a second line.

### Github Style Alerts
You can insert alerts using blockquote syntax that you can use to emphasize critical information. They are displayed with distinctive colors and icons to highlight them to the reader.
To add an alert, use a special blockquote line specifying the alert type, followed by the alert information in a standard blockquote. There are five types of alerts are available (note, tip, important, warning and caution).

```
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes.
