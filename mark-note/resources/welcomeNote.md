## Welcome to MarkNote 👋🏻

MarkNote is a simple **note-taking app** that uses **Markdown** syntax to format your notes.

You can create your first note by clicking on the top-left icon on the sidebar, or delete one by clicking on top right icon.

Following there's a quick overview of the currently supported Markdown syntax.

## Text formatting

This is a **bold** text.
This is an _italic_ text.

## Headings

Here are all the heading formats currently supported by **_MarkNote_**:

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

### Bulleted list

For example, you can add a list of bullet points:

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

### Numbered list

Here we have a numbered list:

1. Numbered list item 1
2. Numbered list item 2
3. Numbered list item 3

### Blockquote

> This is a blockquote. You can use it to emphasize some text or to cite someone.

### Code blocks

You can write code inline `inline code` and in a code block:

```
function test() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

Syntax highlighting is also supported if you provide the language:

```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```
